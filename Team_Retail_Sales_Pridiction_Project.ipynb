A histogram breaks down the data into intervals or bins and shows the frequency of data points in each bin. This helps to identify the range of values that the sales data covers and how the data is spread out across that range. The shape of the histogram can provide insight into the underlying distribution of the data, such as whether it is symmetrical, skewed, or multimodal.

        "The insights from a heatmap chart of a correlation matrix can provide valuable information about the relationships between variables in a dataset. By examining the color intensity and values displayed in the grid, one can identify the strengths of the correlations between the variables, with stronger correlations being represented by brighter colors and larger values. However, it is important to keep in mind that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and that other factors may be at play in determining the relationships between the variables. Nevertheless, analyzing the correlations between variables can be a useful starting point for identifying interesting patterns and relationships in a dataset."
